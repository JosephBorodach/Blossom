/**
 * Approaches:
 * 1. Brute Force
 *      At every point there are two options
 *      Compute every possibility
 *
 * 2.
 *      a. Maintain 2 counts
 *      b. Iterate over the array
 *      c. add current num to pile which minimizes the difference
 *      Or either if it doesn't make a difference
 *
 * Ex: [1,5,11,5]
 *      c1 = 0
 *      c2 = 0
 *      1:
 *          c1 = 1
 *      5:
 *          4 vs 6
 *          c2 = 5
